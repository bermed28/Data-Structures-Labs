Method totalCount() is implemented in Main.java, 

it's a static non-memeber method so I decided to place it in it's own Main class and
call it statically from there.

If you're gonna test out totalCount witha JUnit test case, make sure to change the 
method call to:
	
	 Main.totalCount(s, array);

This way, it's called statically and it can work for any array of type List<String>

Example of JUnit calling it from Main class is on Lab2Tester.java
